      <p>Iâ€™m Catherine, a full stack engineer based in London. I absolutely love coding and my passion leans towards frontend work. I love the design aspect and creativity that comes with frontend development. My current knowledge in coding is: HTML5, CSS/SASS, JavaScript, Ruby, Rails, PostgreSQL, and React. I love learning new languages/libraries and am always looking to further my education.
      <br>
      <br>
      I first started as a Software Quality Assurance Analyst in America, specifically Birmingham, AL. Once I learned the basics of software testing, I was very eager to learn how to actually code. I would fix small UI bugs within the app and loved the satisfaction that came with fixing a problem. When it was time to move back to the United Kingdom, I knew I would not be able to stay on as a QA Analyst overseas. I started looking into web development bootcamps in London and found Le Wagon. I immediately applied and started beginner courses in Ruby to help prepare for an intensive 9 weeks.
      <br>
      <br>
      I finished Le Wagon in March 2022. Le Wagon helped me grow more confident in my code, grasp a true understanding of frontend and backend, and solidified my decision of wanting to grow in the tech industry.</p>
